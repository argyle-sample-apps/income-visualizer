# Income Visualizer

![cover](public/assets/income-viz.png)

Income visualizer offers a centralized dashboard that consolidates users’ income data from many different sources and presents it in intuitive, customizable charts and displays. This gives users valuable insights into their income—like the wages they’ve earned versus received, how earnings from different income streams compare, or how their income breaks down by the day, week, month, or year.

You can try out the Income Visualizer demo [here](https://sampleapps.argyle.com/income-visualizer) and learn more about the features [here](https://docs.argyle.com/guides/docs/income-visualizer).
